1. We would put our automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed.  This is because we want to ensure that we are as safe as possible and always having automated tests that will run for us whenever we make some change to ensure that our merge or new code does not break our main working branch.

3. Should not need a unit test for this feature as we cannot see how the message component interacts/sends elsewhere
4. We could use a unit test for max message length as this doesn't depend on any other code like sending a message check does
